&nbsp;

<strong>Problem Overview: </strong>In this final coding challenge, you are asked to develop a Python program with the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, named <strong>my_school</strong><strong>.py</strong>, that can read data from files and perform some operations. You are required to implement the program following the below requirements. Note that we will give you some files for you to run with your developed program, BUT you should change the data in these files to test your program. During the marking, we will use different data/files to test the behavior of your program.

&nbsp;

<strong>Requirements:</strong> Your code must meet the following <strong>functionalities</strong>, <strong>code</strong>, and <strong>documentation</strong> requirements. Your submission will be graded based on the <strong>rubric</strong> published on Canvas. Please ensure you read all the requirements and the rubric carefully before working on your assignment.

&nbsp;

<strong>A ‚Äì Functionalities Requirements:&nbsp; </strong>

There are <strong><u>4 levels</u></strong>, please ensure you only attempt one level after completing the previous level.

&nbsp;

<strong>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- </strong><strong>PASS LEVEL (15 marks) ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì </strong>

Your project is to implement the required functionalities in the Object-Oriented (OO) style with at least three classes: <strong><em>Results</em></strong>, <strong><em>Course</em></strong>, and<strong><em> Student</em></strong>. You need to design appropriate static/instance variables, constructors, and static/instance methods in these classes. The class related info should be encapsulated inside the corresponding class.

At this level, your program can read data from three files specified in the command line. The files store the course information (<em>course file</em>), student information (<em>student file</em>), and the results of students in these courses (<em>result file</em>). Your program should create a list of <em>Course</em> objects, a list of <em>Student</em> objects, and a variable (you can think carefully about which data type to use) to store the students‚Äô scores. You should design the classes properly so that these actions can be encapsulated within the appropriate classes. Note that, at this level, we only know the IDs of the students and the courses. These IDs are all unique.

In the main class, your program should create a <em>Results</em> object, call its <em>read_courses(course_file_name)</em> method to load data from the course file, <em>read_students(student_file_name)</em> method to load data from the student file, and <em>read_results(result_file_name) </em>method to load data from the result file, and finally call the <em>display_results()</em> method to display the results of the students in the required format (as specified in the following).

Below are examples of the three files: <em>course file</em>,<em> student file</em>, and <em>result file</em>.

In this level, the <em>course file</em> only consists of the course IDs with each course ID being in one line.

&nbsp;

Similarly, in this level, the <em>student file</em> also only consists of the student IDs with each student ID being in one line.

&nbsp;

Finally, for the <em>result file</em>, the data fields in this file are separated by commas and new lines. Each row contains the student ID, the course ID, and the corresponding result of the student for that course. The format of each row is always <em>student_ID, course_ID, score.</em> For example, in our result file example, the student S001 enrolled in the course ISYS089 and got a score of 41.8. Or the student S012 also enrolled in the course ISYS089 and got a score of 76.5. Besides, there will be rows where the scores are empty, meaning the student enrolled in the course but haven‚Äôt got the result of that course yet (ongoing). You can assume there are no duplicate or redundant rows. In this level, you can assume the format of the data in the file is always correct.

&nbsp;

Your program should print a message indicating how to run the program if an incorrect number of data files is passed in as command line arguments. Otherwise, it can display a table showing the scores of all students for all the courses, and two sentences showing the total number of students and courses, and the pass rate (in percent). The score of a student for each course is displayed as a number with 1 digit after the decimal point. In the table, if a student does not enroll in a particular course, then the data field at that location is empty. On the other hand, if a student already enrolled in a course but the result is not available yet, then the data field at that location is shown as a double dash (‚Äì). Also, the data in the columns in the table are aligned, in particular, the student IDs are aligned to the left whilst the scores of all the courses are aligned to the right. Finally, the pass rate is computed as the percentage of passed scores (equal to or larger than 49.5 marks) over the total of available scores. For example, in the example result file above, the total of available scores is 16, and the total of pass scores is 13, therefore, the pass rate is 13/16*100% = 81.25%.

The printed messages corresponding to two scenarios need to be exactly as below:

<ol>
<li>This is an example when a wrong number of arguments is passed in as command line arguments. Note there could be different scenarios for a wrong number of command line arguments, your program needs to handle all.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
<li>This is when a result file, course file, and student file are passed in as command line arguments. Note that users can specify different file names, not necessarily the names <em>txt, courses.txt, students.txt</em>. The first file is always the result file, the second file is the course file, and the last file is the student file.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<h1>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì CREDIT LEVEL (3 marks, you must only attempt this level after completing the PASS level ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-</h1>
At this level, your program can support more information about courses. Now, apart from the ID, each course will have a name, credit point, and offered semester(s). All IDs, names, credits, and offered semesters can be modified. There are two types of courses: <em>Core Course</em> and <em>Elective Course</em>. Core courses can have different credit points whilst all elective courses have the same credit point, which is 6 by default. All core courses are offered in all semesters whilst the elective courses can have different offered semesters. You should define appropriate variables, getters, and setters for courses.

Also, a course should have a method to compute some statistics, e.g., the number of students finished the course, the number of students that are doing the course (on-going), the average score, etc. (it is your choice to define the necessary statistics to compute). You can define extra methods if necessary.

At this level, the course file will have more information. The course file includes the course IDs, the course types, the course names, the credit points, and the offered semester (for elective courses). You can assume there are no duplicate or redundant courses. You can assume all the courses available in this file are also available in the result file (in the PASS level), and vice versa.

&nbsp;

At this level, your program can now print course information tables on screen (in addition to the result information table) and save these tables into a file name <em>reports.txt</em>. For example, given the above result file (in the PASS level) and the course file (in this level), the course information tables should look like below. Note the content within the <em>reports.txt</em> file should also look the same. Also, users can specify different file names, not necessary the names <em>results.txt, courses.txt, students.txt</em>. The first file is always the result file, the second file is the course file, and the last file is the student file.

&nbsp;

The Course information message displays two tables: one table for the core courses and one table for the elective courses. In each table, the CourseID column shows the courses‚Äô IDs, the Name column shows the course names, the Type column shows the types of the courses (C for core courses, and E for elective courses), the Semester column shows the semesters the courses offered (All for all semesters, Sem1 for Semester 1, Sem2 for Semester 2). The Average column displays the average score of all students who finished the course ‚Äì note the average scores are shown with 2 digits after the decimal point. The Nfinish column displays the number of students who already finished the courses (already received marks), and the Nongoing column displays the number students who are still taking the courses (results not yet available).

Note apart from these two tables, your program should also display two messages indicating the most difficult core course and elective course. The most difficult course is the course with the lowest average mark. In each course type, if there are multiple courses with the lowest average marks, you can choose either to display one course or display all courses.

&nbsp;

<h1>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî DI LEVEL (3 marks, you must only attempt this level after completing the CREDIT level) ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî</h1>
At this level, your program can support two types of students: <em>Undergraduate Students</em> and <em>Postgraduate Students.</em> Undergraduate students always need to enroll as full-time students whilst postgraduate students can enroll as either full-time or part-time students. The minimum number of enrolled courses for a full-time student is 4 whist the minimum number of enrolled courses for a parttime student is 2. A student should have a method to compute some useful statistics for the student, e.g., the number of courses they finished, the average GPA, the number of ongoing courses, etc. (it is your choice to define the necessary statistics to compute). It should also have a method to check if a student satisfies the enrollment requirement (enrolling in equal to or more than the minimum number of courses required ‚Äì note these can be courses that students already finished or are currently taking). You can define extra methods for the students if necessary.

At this level, the student file will have more information. The file includes the student IDs, the student names, the student types, and the mode for postgraduate students (full-time or part-time). You can assume there are no duplicate or redundant students. You can assume all students in the result file (in the PASS level) appeared in this file and vice versa. An example of the student file is as follows.

&nbsp;

At this level, your program can now print student information tables on screen (in addition to the result information table and course information tables) and store these tables in the text file <em>reports.txt</em> (from the CREDIT level). Given the above result file (in the PASS level), the course file (in the CREDIT level), and the student file (in this level), the student information tables should look like below. Note the content within the <em>reports.txt</em> file should also look the same. Also, in the command line, users can specify different file names, not necessary the names <em>results.txt, courses.txt, students.txt</em>. The first file is always the result file, the second file is the course file, and the last file is the student file.

&nbsp;

There are two tables, one for Postgraduate students and one for Undergraduate students. The StudentID column shows the student IDs, the Name column shows the student names, the Type column shows the student types (PG for Postgraduate students and UG for Undergraduate students), and the Mode column shows the enroll mode of the students (FT for full-time and PT for part-time). The Nfinish column shows the number of courses the students already finished. The Nongoing column shows the number of courses the students are currently taking. The GPA(100) column displays the average GPAs of the students on a scale of 100. The GPA(4) column displays the average GPAs of the students on a scale of 4: a result &gt;= 79.5 receives 4 points, a result &gt;= 69.5 and &lt; 79.5 receives 3 points, a result &gt;= 59.5 and &lt; 69.5 receives 2 points, a result &gt;= 49.5 and &lt; 59.5 receives 1 point.

In the tables, the data in the <em>StudentID </em>and<em> Name</em> columns are aligned to the left whilst the data in all other columns are aligned to the right. Besides, in the tables, if a student doesn‚Äôt satisfy the requirement of minimum courses enrolled then an exclamation mark (!) will be added next to the student‚Äôs name. For example, in the table above, the student Jack is a full-time student but currently only enrolled in 3 courses, therefore, there is a (!) appears next to the student‚Äôs name.

Apart from the student information tables, two sentences indicating the best Postgraduate student and Undergraduate student, along with their GPA(4) scores, are also shown. The best students are the students with the highest GPA (scale of 4). In each student type, if there are multiple students with the highest scores, you can choose to display one or all these students.

<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<h1>‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì HD LEVEL (6 marks, you must only attempt this level after completing the DI level) ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî</h1>
At this level, your program can handle some variations in the files <u>using built-in/custom exceptions</u>:

<ol>
<li>When any of the file cannot be found, then your program should print a message indicating the names of the files that cannot be found and then quit gracefully. You can assume users always type the file names in the right order in the command line, e.g., the result file first, the course file second, and the student file third.</li>
<li>The program will exit and indicate the corresponding error when one of these errors occurs: a. The result file is empty;
<ol>
<li>Any of the scores in the result file is not a valid number;</li>
<li>The student ID doesn‚Äôt start with the letter S;</li>
<li>The course ID doesn‚Äôt start with either COSC, ISYS or MATH.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
The program will have some additional requirements (some might be challenging):

<ol>
<li>In this level, the student information tables now have one additional column, WGPA(4), which is the weighted GPA(4) based on the course credits. The WGPA(4) of each student is computed by multiplying the scores the student obtained for the courses they took with the credits of those courses, and then dividing by the total credits. For example, the student S034 has a score of 85.7 (equivalent to 4) for COSC123 (with 6 credit points), a score of 89.0 (equivalent to 4) for ISYS089 (with 24 credit points), and a score of 74.5 (equivalent to 3) for ISYS273 (with 12 credit points). Therefore, the WGPA(4) of this student can be computed as (4√ó6 + 4√ó24 + 3√ó12) /(6+24+12) = 3.71. An example of the student information tables with the WGPA(4) columns is shown in the below.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
<li>In this level, the course information tables are sorted (from high to low) based on the Average column (for each course type). Note that this is also reflected in the <em>txt</em> file.</li>
<li>In this level, the student information tables are sorted (from high to low) based on the WGPA(4) column (for each student type). Note that this is also reflected in the <em>txt</em> file.</li>
<li>The <em>txt</em> is accumulated, which means when the program runs, it will not overwrite the previous report, but instead, it places the new report on top of the file (i.e., the newest report is always at the top of the <em>reports.txt</em> file). In addition, the date and time when the report was generated (in the format <em>dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss</em>, e.g. <em>01/06/2023 09:45:00</em>) are also saved in the text file for each report.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>B ‚Äì Code Requirements: </strong>

You must demonstrate your ability to program in Python by yourself, i.e., you should not use any Python packages/libraries that can do most of the coding for you. <strong>The only Python libraries allowed in this assignment is sys, os, and datetime. </strong>If other packages/libraries are used, you will get a 0 mark or a heavy penalty.

<strong>Your program at all levels should be fully OO</strong>, e.g., no variables, methods, or code snippets dangling outside a class. Your main program should simply create an object and run its methods to invoke methods from other classes to perform the required functionalities.

<strong>You should test/verify the program with different text files</strong> (not just run with our text files) to ensure your program satisfies all the required functionalities.

Your code needs to be formatted consistently. You must not include any unused/irrelevant code (even inside the comments). What you submitted must be considered the final product.

You should design your classes carefully. You may use a class diagram to assist with the design. <strong>In the DI and HD levels, you are required to provide a detailed class diagram to show your class design</strong>. <u>An example of a class diagram is shown below on the next page ‚Äì Figure 1</u> (note that this is a class diagram of a different programming assignment). In the diagram, the variables and methods of each class are shown. Note that if your code is at the PASS or CREDIT level, you do not need to submit any diagram; a diagram at these levels would NOT result in any mark.

You could use tools like PowerPoint, Keynotes, or online tools like moqups.com to draw the diagram.

<strong>The diagram needs to be submitted in jpg, gif, png, or pdf format</strong>.

Finally, note that in places where this specification may not tell you how exactly you should implement a certain feature, you need to use your judgment to choose and apply the most appropriate concepts from our course materials. You should follow answers given by your ‚Äúclient‚Äù (or ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù or the teaching team) under Canvas/Discussions/Discussion on Final Coding Challenge.

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li><strong>‚Äì Documentation Requirements: </strong></li>
</ul>
You are required to write comments (documentation) as a part of your code. Writing documentation is a good habit in professional programming. It is particularly useful if the documentation is next to the code segment that it refers to. NOTE that you don‚Äôt need to write an essay, i.e., you should keep the documentation succinct.

<strong>Your comments (documentation) should be in the same Python file. </strong>Please DO NOT write a separate file for comments (documentation).

At the beginning of your Python file, your code must contain the following information:

<ol>
<li><strong>Your name and student ID. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The highest level you have attempted.</strong> This means you have completed all the requirements of the levels below. Mark will be only given at the lowest level of partial completion. For example, if you completed the PASS level, tried 50% of the CREDIT level, 30% of the DI level, 10% of the HD level, then your submission will be marked at the CREDIT level only</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

(we will ignore the DI and HD levels, so please make sure you fully finish one level before moving to the next one).

<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Any problems of your code and requirements that you have not met.</strong> For example, scenarios that might cause the program to crash or behave abnormally, the requirements your program does not satisfy. Note that you do not need to handle or address errors that are not covered in the course.</li>
</ol>
Besides, the comments in this final coding challenge should serve the following purposes:

<ul>
<li>Explain your code in a precise but succinct manner. It should include a brief analysis of your approaches instead of simply translating the Python code to English. For example, you can comment on why you introduce a particular function/method, why you choose to use a while loop instead of other loops, why you choose a particular data type to store the data information. These comments can be placed before the code blocks (e.g., functions/methods, loops, if) and important variable declarations that the comments refer to.</li>
<li>Document some analysis/reflection as a part of your code. Here, you need to write some paragraphs (could be placed at the end or at the beginning of your code) to explain in detail your design process, e.g., how you came up with the design of the program, how you started writing the code after the design process, the challenges you met during the code development.</li>
<li>Document the references, i.e., any sources of information (e.g., websites, tools) you used other than the course contents directly under Canvas/Modules, you must give acknowledgement of the sources, explaining how you use the sources in this assignment. More detailed information regarding the references can be found in Section 5</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
